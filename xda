[CENTER][COLOR="DarkSlateGrey"][SIZE="4"][B]TWRP Recovery for $brand $device by TWRPBuilder Team[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR] [/CENTER]

[SIZE="4"][COLOR="DarkSlateGrey"][URL="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/twrpbuilder-t3744253"]TWRP Builder[/URL][/COLOR] is an open source project that allows you to request TWRP for your unsupported devices.
All it needs is some basic info about your phone, and through our app, it sends us the information to use for creating the TWRP for your device.[/SIZE]

[COLOR="DarkSlateGrey"][SIZE="4"][B]What is TWRP?[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
[URL="http://twrp.me"]Team Win Recovery Project[/URL] 3.x, or twrp3 for short, is a custom recovery built with ease of use and customization in mind. Its a fully touch driven user interface no more volume rocker or power buttons to mash. The GUI is also fully XML driven and completely theme-able. You can change just about every aspect of the look and feel.
In short: It allows you to back up and restore your data, flash custom ROMs to your device, repair broken file systems, and root your device.

[COLOR="DarkSlateGrey"][B]CHANGELOG for 3.2.1-0:[/B][/COLOR]
[HIDE]* minui fixes (cryptomilk)
* Better android-8.0 compatibility in ROM trees (Dees_Troy)
* Fix missing library in android-8.0 (nkk71)
* Fix inconsistent SDCard naming (DevUt)
* Default to TWRP restore instead of adb backup restore to fix restore on fresh TWRP boot (jlask)[/HIDE]
